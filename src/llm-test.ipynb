      "[0001] The present invention relates to a glass composition for glass fiber which is useful as a constitutive component of a composite material that is transparent to a visible light, a glass fiber, a process for producing a glass fiber and a composite material.\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND ART\n",
      "\n",
      "[0002] Glass fibers utilized for constituting a variety of composite materials not only have good mechanical properties such as strength and elasticity, but also show excellent fire-retardant and lightweight properties when they are formulated into composite materials. Hence, they have achieved wide use in many applications, including structural and functional materials for which various performances are required. Even in limited fields of information and electronic industries that are expected to carry a next generation, glass fibers have been essentials in uses such as printed circuit board, insulation sheet, IC substrate, various terminal strips, and housing material for electronic devices such as electronic parts. In the production of such glass fibers, continuous forming and spinning operations are generally carried out using a forming device, called a bushing (also referred to as a platinum heating container), which is made of a noble metal and has a generally rectangular appearance and heat resistance. This bushing is constructed in a vessel-like configuration that serves to permit a molten glass to dwell therein. This heat-resisting container has a number of vertical nozzles located at its bottom. After having been brought to a homogeneous state in a glass-melting furnace, the molten glass in the container is controlled at a temperature in the vicinity of a forming temperature (also called a spinning temperature) that corresponds to its high-temperature viscosity of 103 dpa•s and then drawn through the heat-resisting nozzles to form glass fibers.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0003] Glass fibers and organic resin materials can be combined into a composite material capable of transmitting a visible light by matching an Abbe number and a refractive index of the glass fibers with those of the transparent organic resin materials. A representing use of such a transparent composite material is as a composite material for an image display substrate. A number of inventions have been practiced for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0004] For example, Patent Document 1 discloses an invention which combines glass fibers having a refractive index of 1.45-1.55 with the corresponding resin to formulate a transparent composite composition having an Abbe number of not less than 45. Patent Document 2 discloses an invention which uses, as a component of a transparent composite material, an epoxy resin which has a refractive index that falls within 0.01 from that of a glass filler, a low expansion coefficient and a purity of at least 85% as determined from an oxirane oxygen content. Patent Documents 3 and 4 disclose glass fiber compositions which have a refractive index that falls within 0.001 from that of a polycarbonate resin. Patent Document 5 discloses a glass fiber thermoplastic resin composite having improved transparency, coloring and surface appearance, which contains a specific proportion of a glass fiber and a resin such as aromatic polycarbonate. Patent Document 6 discloses a resin sheet useful for a display device substrate,\n",
      "\n",
      "which comprises a cloth-like structure made of a glass fiber and a resin having a haze value of not exceeding 10%, with a refractive index difference of 0.01. Patent Document 7 discloses an invention which provides a transparent composite sheet, as an alternative of a glass substrate, by stacking glass fibers so as for them to orient with an axial deviation of 10 degrees-80 degrees.\n",

      "DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "\n",
      "[0012] However, the inventions as proposed heretofore, if alone, have been insufficient to realize a glass fiber which has adequate mechanical properties and exhibits diverse optical performances, which can suppress the occurrence of glass defect such as devitrification, which has such an excellent quality level of appearance that results in achievement of high performances, and which can be efficiently produced. Accordingly, there remain problems to be solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0013] That is, if a composite material is to exhibit a high optical quality, it must have a visible light transmittance commensurate therewith. However, none of composite materials as provided heretofore by combining a glass fiber and an organic resin achieves a high visible light transmittance at a wavelength in the approximate range from 340 nm to 800 nm. Although possible to realize a high transmittance of a visible light at a specific wavelength, they scarcely transmit a visible light at the other wavelength and accordingly appear colored, which has been a problem. A composite material in this application, even if in the form of a thinner sheet than conventional, is still required to have sufficiently high mechanical strength properties. However, the effort to bring its optical properties to proper values eases precipitation of a crystal in a molten glass during production of glass fibers. Inclusion of a crystalline foreign substance in the formed glass fibers causes devitrification in the glass fiber product and accordingly lowers a production efficiency of glass fibers, which has been another problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0014] The inventors of this application have noticed that the successful reduction of various glass defects in the molten glass during glass fiber production enables stable production of glass fibers and thus leads to efficient production of defect-free high-quality glass fibers for composite material, whereby such glass fibers when utilized as a composite material component can impart not only high optical properties but also high strength properties to the resulting composite material. [0015] None of the aforementioned Patent Documents 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 pays attention to various properties or material types of glass fibers. For example, the S glass described in Patent Document 1 certainly has desired values for refractive index and Abbe number. However, it has achieved enhanced strength by incorporating at least 20% by mass ofAl203. This\n",

Patent Document 2 also lists types of existing glass fiber materials, i.e., E glass, T glass, C glass and A glass. However, these are not suited for the invention of this application. Patent Documents 3 and 4 are concerned with glass fiber materials but focused on their compatibility with polycarbonate. No consideration is given to more other transparent resin materials in combination with those materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0016] After the extensive research on the above-described problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a glass composition for glass fiber which is highly matched in optical constants with a transparent resin having a refractive index of 1.47-1.56, such as an epoxy, cyclic olefin or acrylic resin, which has a high affinity for a resin and good adhesion and which shows superior melt properties, spinnability and chemical durability during a glass production process; a glass fiber; a process for producing the glass fiber; and a composite material using the glass fiber.\n",

      "\n",
      "[0021] That is, it is meant that, when the glass-constituting elemental components are each expressed in terms of oxide by using various measuring means such as chemical analysis and instrumental analysis, an SiO2 component is in the range of 60-75% by mass, an Al203 component is not greater than 10% by mass, an B2O3 component is not greater than 20% by mass, a total amount of an Li2O component, an Na2O component and a K2O component is in the range from 5% by mass to 15% by mass, a total amount of 5 components, i.e., a total amount of MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO and ZnO components is not greater than 10% by mass, a TiO2 component is not greater than 10% by mass, and a ZrO2 component is not greater than 10% by mass.\n",

      "total amount of the Li2O, Na2O and K2O components is from 5% by mass to 14% by mass, and the ZrO2 component is in the range of not exceeding 5% by mass. In the more preferred embodiment of the present invention, a total amount of the 5 components, i.e., MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO and ZnO components, is not greater than 8% by mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0023] The reason for which each constitutive component of the glass composition of the present invention is contained in the amount specified above is now described specifically. [0024] The SiO2 component is a skeleton component of a glass structure and accordingly is a main constitutive component of the glass composition of the present invention. The strength of the glass structure tends to increase with increase in the content of the SiO2 component in the glass composition. On the other hand, the increase in content of the SiO2 component in the glass composition increases a high-temperature viscosity value of a molten glass and accordingly makes it difficult to form a glass. As a result, if such a glass composition is to be homogeneously conditioned by a melting process, expensive facilities must be installed. In some cases, limitation may be imposed on the facility control during glass production. In order that the strength of the glass structure is maintained in a sufficient condition and is rendered high, it is necessary that the content of the SiO2 component is at least 60% by mass, more preferably at least 63% by mass. On the other hand, in order to assure a productivity of glass fibers by insuring high processability and rendering it unnecessary to apply an excessive thermal energy in melting a glass, it is necessary that the content of the SiO2 component does not exceed 75% by mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0025] The Al203 component is a component which is effective in realizing chemical and mechanical stability of a glass. If it is contained in a glass by a proper amount, precipitation of a crystal in a molten glass is effectively prevented. On the other hand, excessive inclusion thereof increases a viscosity of the molten glass. It is accordingly necessary that the content of the Al203 component in the glass composition does not exceed 10% by mass. The Al203 component also increases an elastic modulus of a glass. The higher content of the Al203 component increases the difficulty of the formed glass to deform when an external force is applied thereto. Accordingly, in order to maintain a molten glass in a condition suitable for spinning of glass fibers and sufficiently obtain a crystallization preventing effect as well as an elastic modulus increasing effect, it is preferred that the content of the Al203 component is at least 1% by mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0026] The B2O3 component is a skeleton component of a glass structure, as similar to the SiO2 component. Unlike the SiO2 component, it does not increase a high-temperature viscosity of a molten glass but rather acts to lower the high-temperature viscosity of a molten glass. However, the excessively high content of the B2O3 component in the glass composition increases a vaporization of the B2O3 component from a molten glass, resulting in the difficulty to maintain the molten glass in a homogeneous condition. Also, the higher content of the B2O3 component increases the tendency of a glass to undergo phase separation. The occurrence of phase separation is not desirable because it in some cases impairs chemical durability or optical properties. From this point of view, it is necessary that the content of the B2O3 component in the glass composition does not exceed 20% by mass. Also, in order for the B2O3 component to enhance its effect to lower the high-temperature viscosity of a molten glass while maintaining the strength of the glass structure as a skeleton com-\n",

      "\n",
      "[0027] The TiO2 component is a component which, if increased in content in the glass composition, increases a refractive index (nd) that is an optical constant of a glass and lowers an Abbe number (vd) that is another optical constant. Also, in the case where the glass composition contains an alkali metal element, the TiO2 component is in some cases effective in restraining the amount of alkali elution. So long as such effects are remarkable, the content of the TiO2 component is more preferably at least 0.1% by mass, further preferably at least 0.3% by mass, further more preferably at least 0.5% by mass, most preferably at least 1.0% by mass. Also, the TiO2 component is an effective component to properly control the refractive index and Abbe number by its loading. However, the increased content of the TiO2 component in the glass composition sometimes increases a refractive index of the glass excessively. The increased content of the TiO2 component in the glass composition also increases a tendency of a crystal containing titanium (Ti) to precipitate in the glass melt and further increases the occurrence of phase separation that increases a tendency of a crystal containing silicon (Si) to precipitate in the glass melt. In either case, devitrification develops in the molten glass to hinder production of homogeneous glass. Also, the increased content of the TiO2 component in the glass may color the glass for some glass compositions, which is not desirable. From these standpoints, in order that a stable glass composition is provided which has an Abbe number (vd) approximate to that of a transparent resin material to be combined with the glass into a composite material and which restrains development of devitrification and causes no problem on coloring, it is necessary that the content of the TiO2 component in the glass composition does not exceed 10% by mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0028] The ZrO2 component is a component which acts to increase a refractive index (nd) of a glass and lowers an Abbe number (vd), as similar to the aforementioned TiO2 component, but does not color the glass, as contrary to the TiO2 component. However, an increase in content of the ZrO2 component in the glass composition tends to ease precipitation of a crystal containing zirconium (Zr) in a molten glass and hinder spinning of glass fibers due to devitrification. Accordingly, in order to adjust optical constants of the glass fibers, such as a refractive index, to proper values relative to the transparent resin material as well as to hinder devitrification so that production of stable glass fibers can be achieved, an upper limit in content of the ZrO2 component in the glass composition is set at 10% by mass. That is, it is necessary that the content of the ZrO2 component in the glass composition does not to exceed 10% by mass. More preferably, it is maintained not to exceed 5% by mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0029] The alkali metal oxide represented by the Li2O, Na2O and K2O components and expressed in terms of oxide in the glass composition serves as a so-called flux to ease formation of a glass melt as plural glass raw materials in a mixed condition are rendered into the glass melt by heating. The alkali metal oxide component, if TiO2 content in the glass composition is high, also serves to restrain the occurrence of devitrification in the glass melt. However, undesirable results occur where the alkali metal oxide content becomes too high. The excessively high content of the alkali metal oxide component in the glass composition in some cases inhibits curing of the transparent resin as it is combined with the glass fiber\n",
      "\n",
      "into a composite material. Also in this case, after the glass fiber and transparent resin are combined into a composite material, the bond strength at an interface between them decreases with time due to the effect of the alkali metal element in the glass composition. This reduces a strength of the composite material and accordingly lowers its reliability as a structural material. Also, if the content of the alkali metal oxide component in the glass composition increases, a refractive index of the glass may become too high, which is not desirable. From these standpoints, if the total content of the Li2O, Na2O and K2O components, expressed in % by mass, is maintained not to fall below 5%, these components act sufficiently as a flux to promote melting of the glass and improve an efficiency of glass production. Also, they exhibit a remarkable action to adjust a refractive index of the glass to a proper value and remedy a tendency of the glass having a high TiO2 content toward devitrification. On the other hand, if the total content ofthe Li2O, Na2O and K2O components, expressed in % by mass, is maintained not to exceed 15%, combining the glass fibers with transparent resin results in the formation of a composite material which has a proper refractive index value. Also, the transparent resin is not hindered from curing as the composite material is formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0030] As a result, transparency and strength of the formed transparent composite material can be stabilized. From such standpoints, in order for the composite material to exhibit stable performances, it is desirable that the total content of the Li2O, Na2O and K2O components, expressed in % by mass, is more preferably maintained not to exceed 14% by mass. [0031] Also because the Na2O component, among the alkali metal oxides, has a higher likelihood of leaching out from a glass surface, leach out thereof, if occurs, may adversely affect adhesion between the resin and glass fiber when combined to form the composite material. It is accordingly desirable that the content of the Na2O component is preferably maintained not to exceed 9% by mass. If the content of the Na2O component is kept within 9% by mass, the amount of the alkali component that leaches out from a glass surface can be reduced. The occurrence of a problem regarding adhesion at an interface between the resin and the glass fiber can also be reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0032] The five components expressed as divalent oxides, i.e., MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO and ZnO components, all act as a flux to promote melting of a glass raw material and ease melting of a glass, although their actions are not so effective as the preceding alkali metal oxides. They are also effective in adjusting the optical constants, such as a refractive index and an Abbe number, to proper levels. On the other hand, the excessively high contents thereof undesirably increase the tendency of crystals containing these components to precipitate. Also undesirably, the refractive index (nd) of the glass becomes too high. From these standpoints, it is necessary that the total content of the MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO and ZnO components is maintained not to exceed 10% by mass, more preferably 8% by mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "[0033] Also, the ZnO component, if used for the glass composition containing an alkali metal element, is in some cases effective in reducing the amount of alkali elution. So long as such an effect is remarkable, it is desirable that the content of the ZnO component is more preferably at least 0.1% by mass, further preferably at least 0.3% by mass, still further preferably at least 0.5% by mass.\n",
