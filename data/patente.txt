GLASS WITH HIGH REFRACTIVE INDEX
FOR FIBER OPTIC IMAGING ELEMENT
WITH MEDIUM-EXPANSION AND
FABRICATION METHOD THEREFOR

TECHNICAL FIELD

[0001] The present invention relates to the field of tech-
nology of raw materials of fiber optic imaging elements
and glass materials, in particular to a glass with high refrac-
tive index for fiber optic imaging elements with medium-
expansion and fabrication method therefor.

BACKGROUD TECHNOLOGY

[0002] Fiber optic imaging elements include fiber optic
faceplates, fiber optic image inverters, fiber optic tapers,
fiber optic bundle for image transmission, etc. Fiber optic
imaging elements are photoelectric imaging devices with
excellent performance, which is fabricated by unique com-
positions of cladding glass, core glass and absorbing glass,
and is fabricated by a drawing process of vacuum control
and rod-tube combination, so that the product has good air
tightness, small distortion, less spots, simple structure, small
volume, light weight, large numerical aperture, high light
transmission efficiency, small inter-stage coupling loss,
high coupling efficiency, high resolution, clear and true
image transmission, zero thickness image transfer and
other characteristics, which can effectively improve the
edge image quality. Fiber optic imaging elements are high-
resolution imaging elements which formed by arranging
tens of millions of optical fibers in parallel and heat press
fusion process, and are key materials for image intensifiers
and high-definition displays, which are widely used in var-
ious cathode ray displays, camera tube, CCD coupling, low-
level-light night vision, medical equipment display, high-
definition TV imaging and other instruments and equip-
ments that need to transmit images in military, criminal
investigation, aerospace, medicine and other fields, and
which is a high-tech product in the industry of photoelectron
in 21 century.

[0003] The most typical application of fiber optic imaging
elements is as the optical input and output windows of low-
level-light image intensifiers, which make an important role
in improving the quality of imaging devices, and which in
application need to be sealed with Kovar alloy, so effective
sealing and matching with Kovar alloy having a similar
coefficient of linear thermal expansion (50*10-7/°C) is
required to improve the stability and prolong the service
life of the low-level-light image tube. Fiber optic imaging
elements currently used in China use a high expansion sys-
tem with a coefficient of thermal expansion in the range of
(87+45)*10-7/°C, which is far from the sealing matching
degree of Kovar alloy. In order to improve the thermal sta-
bility of the image intensifier device, it is necessary to adopt
the fiber optic imaging elements with medium-expansion
system, but there is no suitable material with medium-
expansion system at present.

prior, the present invention provides a glass with high
tefractive index for fiber optic imaging elements with med-
ium-expansion and fabrication method therefor.

Aug. 3, 2023

[0025] The glass with a high refractive index for a fiber
optic imaging element with medium-expansion provided
by the present invention is suitable for use as the core
glass of optical fibers in the fabrication for the fiber optic
imaging element with medium-expansion.

[0026] The glass with high refractive index of the present
invention has a sealing matching degree with Kovar alloy
and a good thermal stability, and adopts the fiber optic ima-
ging element with medium-expansion with the coefficient of
expansion of (68+5)10-7/°C to have a better thermal stabi-
lity, adapt to temperature changes in a wider range of envir-
onments such as deserts, plateaus, snow-covered areas,
oceans, jungles, ete., and further to increase application per-
formance and service life of the low-level-light image tube.
[0027] In the present invention, SiO, is a glass-forming
oxide, which plays an important role in the glass net, and
improves chemical resistance. The weight percentage
(wt.%) of SiO, is 5-9. When the content of SiO. is lower
than 5 wt.%, it is difficult to obtain a glass with medium-
expansion coefficient, and the chemical resistance stability
of the glass is reduced at the same time; when the content of
SiO, is higher than 10 wt.%, the high temperature viscosity
of the glass will increase. As a result, the melting tempera-
ture of the glass is too high and the probability of the glass
phase separation increases at the same time.

[0028] Al,O; is an intermediate oxide of the glass, and
Al3* has two coordination states, that is, in tetrahedron or
octahedron. When the content of oxygen is enough in the
glass, an aluminum-oxygen tetrahedron [AlO,] is formed
and forms a continuous network with a silicon-oxygen tetra-
hedron. When the content of oxygen is insufficient in the
glass, an aluminum-oxygen octahedron [AlOg] is formed,
which is the network modifier and is in the hole of the sili-
con-oxygen structure network, so Al,O3 and SiO, could
form the main body of the glass network in a certain content
range. The weight percentage (wt.%) of Al,O; is 0-1, and
when the content of Al,O; is higher than 1 wt.%, the high
temperature viscosity of the glass will increase. As a result,
the glass melting temperature is too high and the devitrifica-
tion performance declines at the same time.

[0029] B.0; is a glass-forming oxide, and also the main
component of the glass net, and also a fluxing agent to redu-
cing glass melting viscosity. Boron-oxygen triangle [BO3]
and boron-oxygen tetrahedron [BO,] are the structural com-
ponents, and boron may exist as triangle [BO 3] or boron-
oxygen tetrahedron [BO,] under different conditions. In
high temperature melting conditions, it is difficult to form
boron-oxygen tetrahedron, and can only exist in the form of
trihedral, but at low temperature, B3* has the tendency to
capture free oxygen to form tetrahedron under certain con-
ditions, which makes the structure compact to improves the
low temperature viscosity of glass, as it has the characteris-
tics of reducing the glass viscosity at high temperature and
increasing the glass viscosity at low temperature, and it is
also the main component to reduce the refractive index of
glass, which determines that its content range is small. The
weight percentage (wt.%) of B2O3 is 23-28. when the con-
tent of B20; is lower than 23 wt.%, which cannot play the
tole to help melting and meanwhile reduces the chemical
stability of the glass; when the content of B2O3 is more
than 28 wt.%, which will reduce the refractive index of the
glass and meanwhile increase the tendency of the glass
phase separation.
US 2023/0242436 Al

[0030] In the present invention, the network former oxides
with high content of BO; and SiO» will decline the refrac-
tive index of the glass, thus it is impossible to achieve med-
ium-expansion, or the glass system has a more tendency to
devitrification under the condition of certain combinations
of rare earth metal oxides and conventional network former
oxides. For these reasons, the content of B2O3 must be more
than the content of SiO,.

[0031] CaO is a network modifier oxide of glass structure,
and the weight percentage (wt.%) of CaO is 0-3. When the
content of CaO is more than 3 wt.%, the chemical resistance
stability of the glass is reduced, and the coefficient of ther-
mal expansion of the glass is increased.

[0032] BaO is a network modifier oxide of glass structure,
which can effectively improve the refractive index of glass.
The weight percentage (wt.%) of BaO is 6-12. When the
content of BaO is less than 6 wt.%, the refractive index of
glass is reduced; when the content of BaO is more than
12 wt.%, the devitrification temperature of the glass is
increased, the devitrification tendency of the glass is
increased, and the density of the glass is increased signifi-
cantly at the same time.

[0033] La2Os is a lanthanide series rare earth oxide, which
can improve the refractive index of glass. The weight per-
centage (wt.%) of La.O3 is 30-34, when the content of
La,O3 is more than 34 wt.%, the coefficient of thermal
expansion of the glass will increase; when the content of
La,03 is less than 30 wt.%, it will decrease the refractive
index of the glass .

[0034] Nb.Os is also a rare earth oxide, which can
improve the refractive index and the process performance
of glass, and lengthen the liquid fragility of glass. The
weight percentage (wt.%) of Nb2Os is 4-8, when the content
of Nb2Os is more than 8 wt.%, the density and coefficient of
thermal expansion of the glass is increased; when the con-
tent of Nb2Os is less than 4 wt.%, the refractive index of the
glass is decreased. “high or low liquid fragility” refers to the
steep of slope of the viscosity-temperature curve of the glass
in the viscosity range of 102-1015 dPas, that is, the fluctuate
level of the viscosity of the glass with temperature change in
this viscosity range. The glass in the present invention has
the advantage of being slightly stronger liquid fragility of
glass than the comparable glass of the prior art in both cri-
tical temperature ranges, and the glass in the present inven-
tion is easier to handle and reduce stripes.

[0035] Ta2Os is also a rare earth oxide, which can increase
the refractive index of glass. The weight percentage (wt.%)
of Ta,O; is 0-1, when the content of Ta,O; is more than
1 wt.%, the density and coefficient of thermal expansion of
the glass is increased, and the manufacturing cost will
increased at the same time.

[0036] Y.O3 is also a rare earth oxide, which can improve
the refractive index and the process performance of glass
and reduce the melting temperature and devitrification tem-
perature of glass. The weight percentage (wt.%) of Y203; is
0-1 .When the content of YO; is more than | wt.%, the cost
of glass is increased.

[0037] ZnO is used to reduce the melting temperature of
glass, and improve the chemical resistance and refractive
index of glass, the weight percentage (wt.%) of ZnO is 4-
9%. When the content of ZnO is more than 9 wt.%, the che-
mical resistance stability of glass is reduced and the coeffi-
cient of thermal expansion of glass is increased; when the

Aug. 3, 2023

content of ZnO is less than 4 wt.%, the refractive index of
glass will reduced.

[0038] TiO, is used to improve the refractive index and
the transmittance of glass and increase the oxide of the
glass network, thereby reducing the density and high tem-
perature viscosity of glass, which is beneficial to the fining
of the glass melt and the elimination of stripes in the process
of glass melting. The weight percentage (wt.%) of TiO, is 4-
8. When the content of TiO, is more than 8 wt.%, the coeffi-
cient of thermal expansion of glass is increased; when the
content of TiO, is less than 4 wt.%, the refractive index of
glass is reduced. In the high refractive index glass of the
present invention, TiO, can react with iron impurity to
form brown iron-titanate complex; in addition, the combina-
tion of TiO, and rare earth metal oxides, Ta,O;, Nb2Os is
very challenging in terms of process, because Nb2Os also
teleases oxygen at high temperatures and competes free
oxygen with TiO, which is still dissolved in the glass; if
the process is not precisely controlled, the result may be a
brown glass.

[0039] ZrO, is used to improve the refractive index and
the transmittance of glass, and has the effect of adjusting
optical performances and improving the chemical resis-
tance. The weight percentage (wt.%) of ZrO is 4-6. When
the content of ZrO, is more than 6 wt.%, the glass melting
temperature and the devitrification tendency will increased.
[0040] SnO,z is used to fining the glass melting, which can
improve the chemical resistance and the transmittance of
glass. The weight percentage (wt.%) of SnO, is 0 ~1%.
When the content of SnO; is more than 1 wt.%, the bubbles
inside the glass will increased.

[0041] In the present invention, the following expressions
“without X” or “not contain component X” mean that com-
ponent X hardly exists in the glass, that is, if any, the com-
ponent exists only as an impurity, which is not added to the
composition as a desired component. The glass of the pre-
sent invention belongs to boron lanthanum barium silicate
glass, and the glass does not contain heavy metal oxides
such as As2O3, $b203, PbO, CdO, etc., which are seriously
harmful to the environment, even if there is an extremely
microelement amount, it is due to the introduction of other
raw materials of the glass.
